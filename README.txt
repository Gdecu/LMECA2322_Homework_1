The folders pencils_x/y/z contain the 3 x 4 x 4 pencils used for the HW.
Each text file corresponds to one pencil.
In the text files, each line corresponds to a simulation point (there are thus 32768 lines). The 3 columns are the components of the velocity field (u,v,w).
Mind the fact that this simulation is periodic. The last data point is a valid point, i.e., it is not equal to the first data point.
